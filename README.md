# Franchise-Decision-to-Invest-in-Prominent-Locations
The problem I am considering is to compare the neighborhoods of three cities in three different countries. The countries I have selected are Germany, Canada and USA, cities are Berlin, Alberta and New Orleans.  Checking which neighborhoods of the 3 cities are similar in order to expand and open a new franchise.
